# Minimal Library Management System üìö

## Project Overview
Develop a minimal library management system using React, Redux Toolkit and TypeScript. The system will allow users to view a list of books, perform CRUD operations, borrow books, and view a simple borrow summary‚Äîall without authentication, category filters, or payment integration.

The main goal is to build a functional and clean client-side application that interacts with a RESTful API, demonstrating proper state management, UI design, and core functionality.
